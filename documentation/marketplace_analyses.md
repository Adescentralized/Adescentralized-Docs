## 1. Executive Summary & Introduction

<i>We are Adescentralized, an advertising distribution platform that uses blockchain to ensure transparent and fair payments for all parties involved. Our mission is to connect businesses with a genuine audience, ensuring that every view is verified and properly rewarded.<i>


Adescentralized is a decentralized advertising platform that revolutionizes the way ads are distributed and rewarded. Our goal is to create a transparent and fair advertising ecosystem that benefits everyone involved: businesses, hosting websites, and most importantly, users.

Our solution consists of three interconnected components, all powered by blockchain technology.

Businesses use our website to easily and intuitively manage their advertising campaigns. A comprehensive dashboard allows them to set budgets and monitor performance in real time, with access to detailed metrics such as views, engagement, and lead generation. Every ad view and user interaction is securely recorded on the blockchain, complete with a verification hash and an encrypted user ID, ensuring complete data integrity.

For end users, our browser extension serves as the gateway. Once activated, users can choose to view ads and, in return, are financially rewarded for each impression. We use XLM (Stellar Lumens) from the Stellar network to enable fast, secure transactions with minimal fees—delivering on our promise of real, tangible rewards for users’ attention.

Additionally, partner websites integrate our solution to display ads and automatically receive a share of the advertiser’s investment through smart contracts. This ensures a fully automated payment process without intermediaries.

Stellar forms the foundation of our platform. Its global payment infrastructure—capable of processing transactions in seconds at fractions of a cent—is the only network robust enough to support our large-scale, per-impression reward model.

At every stage, we act as guardians of transparency. We manage the invested capital, validate ad views through our API, and ensure fair distribution of funds between users and publisher sites.

Adescentralized proves that advertising can be decentralized, beneficial, and transparent—for everyone.



> **Example**:  
> *RemitSwift is a decentralized remittance platform built on the Stellar network that enables near-instant, low-cost cross-border payments for unbanked migrant workers. By leveraging Stellar’s fast settlement and low fees, we reduce transaction costs by up to 90% compared to traditional remittance services.*

## 2. Problem Statement: The Pain Points

### Key Problems:

**Field Research: Validation of Adescentralized's Core Problems**

* a. Advertising as the Primary Method for Lead Generation in Businesses

Lead generation is widely recognized as one of the most critical objectives in marketing, with paid advertising playing a central role in acquiring quality leads. According to industry statistics, **91% of marketers consider lead generation their top priority**, highlighting its importance in driving business growth[^5]. This aligns with the fact that lead generation acts as the foundation of the sales funnel, connecting businesses with potential customers and enabling revenue growth[^4]. Paid advertising is particularly effective in outbound lead generation strategies, allowing companies to proactively reach target audiences[^1]. Furthermore, platforms like social media enable businesses to use targeted advertising to reach specific demographics, resulting in higher-quality leads[^3]. Given this context, efficient and trustworthy advertising systems are essential for sustainable business development.

* b. High Costs of Digital Advertising on Current Platforms

Despite its effectiveness, digital advertising has become increasingly expensive, especially on dominant platforms like Google and Facebook. For example, the average cost-per-click (CPC) on Google Search Ads ranges from **$2.32 to $2.69**, while costs on the Google Display Network average around **$0.63–$0.67**[^11][^13]. In some industries, such as legal or real estate, CPCs can exceed **$4**[^20]. On Facebook, average CPC varies between **$0.58 and $1.35**, depending on the source, with CPM (cost per thousand impressions) ranging from **$8.60 to $14.40**[^11][^17][^19]. These high costs place significant pressure on marketing budgets, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. As competition intensifies, advertisers face rising prices for visibility, making it harder to achieve a positive return on investment. The financial burden of these platforms underscores the need for more cost-efficient alternatives.

* c. Lack of Transparency and Fraud in the Digital Advertising Industry

A major systemic issue in digital advertising is the lack of transparency regarding ad performance, audience verification, and budget allocation. Industry surveys indicate that trust remains a critical problem due to practices like hidden rebates and digital fraud[^21]. Ad fraud alone is a multi-billion dollar problem, involving deceptive practices that misrepresent metrics such as views and clicks, ultimately draining advertising budgets without delivering real engagement[^24]. In the first half of 2019, app install fraud cost the industry **$2.3 billion**, illustrating the scale of the issue[^22]. Fraudulent activities not only inflate costs but also distort performance data, leading to poor decision-making and inefficient use of marketing resources[^25]. This lack of accountability undermines confidence in current advertising models and highlights the need for verifiable, tamper-proof systems.

* d. Inefficiencies Caused by Intermediaries in the Ad Tech Ecosystem

The digital advertising supply chain involves numerous intermediaries—such as ad networks, demand-side platforms, and data providers—that collectively take a significant portion of the advertising budget. Studies show that middlemen fees can range from **22% to 45%** of each ad impression, with an average of **35% being absorbed by ad-tech players** before reaching publishers[^38]. This inefficiency means that a large share of advertiser spending does not go toward actual content delivery or audience engagement. Despite efforts toward supply-path optimization, an estimated **$26.8 billion is still lost annually** due to structural inefficiencies in programmatic advertising[^34]. The complexity and opacity of these transactions make it difficult for advertisers to assess the true value they receive, reinforcing the need for a decentralized, automated system that minimizes intermediaries and maximizes transparency.

---

These findings confirm that the problems Adescentralized seeks to address—high costs, lack of transparency, ad fraud, and excessive intermediary fees—are well-documented and deeply rooted in the current digital advertising landscape. By leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and a user-reward model, Adescentralized offers a timely and validated solution to these pressing industry challenges.
