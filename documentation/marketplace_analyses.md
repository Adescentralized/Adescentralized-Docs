## 1. Executive Summary & Introduction

In one paragraph, summarize:
- What your project does
- Who it helps
- Why it matters
- How it uses Stellar

> **Example**:  
> *RemitSwift is a decentralized remittance platform built on the Stellar network that enables near-instant, low-cost cross-border payments for unbanked migrant workers. By leveraging Stellar’s fast settlement and low fees, we reduce transaction costs by up to 90% compared to traditional remittance services.*

---

## 2. Problem Statement: The Pain Points

### Key Problems:
- High cost of international money transfers
- Slow settlement times (3–5 days)
- Lack of access for unbanked/underbanked populations
- Poor transparency in FX rates and fees
- Fragmented financial identity across borders

### Stakeholder Pain-Gain Map:

| Stakeholder | Pain | Gain |
|-----------|------|------|
| Migrant Workers | Pay high fees to send money home | Fast, cheap, reliable way to support family |
| Recipients (e.g., families) | Delayed funds, no tracking | Real-time visibility and instant access |
| Small Remittance Providers | High operational costs | Lower overhead via decentralized rails |

## 4. Market Analysis

### 4.1 TAM, SAM, SOM Analysis

| Metric | Definition | Estimate | Source |
|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| **TAM** (Total Addressable Market) | Global cross-border payment volume | $150B+/year | World Bank, 2023 |
| **SAM** (Serviceable Available Market) | Digital remittances in emerging markets | $75B/year | Statista, McKinsey |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) | Realistic capture in Year 1 (e.g., 0.1%) | $75M | Internal estimate |

> 💡 Use real data. Example: In 2023, global remittances reached $647B (World Bank). Focus on digital segment.

---

### 4.2 Porter’s Five Forces

| Force | Analysis |
|------|---------|
| **1. Threat of New Entrants** | Low barrier due to open-source tools; trust & UX are key differentiators |
| **2. Bargaining Power of Buyers** | High – users compare speed, cost, reliability |
| **3. Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | Low – Stellar is permissionless; cloud infra is commoditized |
| **4. Threat of Substitutes** | High – PayPal, Wise, cash corridors, informal hawala |
| **5. Industry Rivalry** | Intense – legacy players vs. crypto startups |

---

### 4.3 PESTEL Analysis

| Factor | Impact on Project |
|-------|------------------|
| **Political** | Regulatory scrutiny of crypto; some countries restrict foreign remittance apps |
| **Economic** | Inflation, currency instability increase need for stable digital assets |
| **Social** | Growing mobile penetration in Africa, LATAM, SEA enables adoption |
| **Technological** | Stellar’s Horizon API, SDKs, Soroban enable innovation |
| **Environmental** | Near-zero carbon footprint of Stellar = ESG advantage |
| **Legal** | KYC/AML compliance required for fiat on/off ramps |

---

## 5. SWOT Analysis

| **Strengths** ✅ | **Weaknesses** ❌ |
|------------------|------------------|
| Built on low-cost, fast Stellar network | Limited brand recognition |
| Solves real pain in emerging markets | Requires user education about crypto |
| Uses Soroban for smart contracts (if applicable) | Dependency on third-party wallets |

| **Opportunities** 🚀 | **Threats** ⚠️ |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Partner with mobile money providers (M-Pesa, etc.) | Regulatory crackdowns |
| Integrate with CBDC pilots | Competition from Ripple, Visa B2B Connect |
| Expand into payroll for gig workers | Incumbent network effects |
